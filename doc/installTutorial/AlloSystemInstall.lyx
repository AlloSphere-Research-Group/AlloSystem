\begin_layout Section
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This tutorial explains how to install AlloSystem under Linux Ubuntu, Mac
 OS X, and Windows.
 The simplest way of working with AlloSystem is through the command-line
 interface with tools like 
\family typewriter
GCC
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
make
\family default
.
 The first part of the tutorial explains how to install the necessary developmen
t tools for compiling code.
 The second part describes how to install AlloSystem.
 The last part explains how to compile and run custom applications using
 AlloSystem.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Read the instructions in each section very carefully since skipping an installat
ion step which likely cause things to fail during later steps.
 During each installation step, be sure to carefully monitor any output
 for errors.
 If an error does arise, you can refer to 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand nameref
reference "sec:Troubleshooting"

\end_inset

 to find solutions to common problems.
 In addition, be careful when copy and pasting commands from this document
 as it can introduce extra spaces leading to malformed paths, etc.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Supported Operating Systems
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Currently, the following operating systems are known to work with AlloSystem:

\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Get Development Tools
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first step is to obtain the development tools necessary to compile and
 run AlloSystem programs.
 It is imperative that you maintain a good internet connection throughout
 the installation process as many packages need to be downloaded.
 Skip to the platform you are using and follow the instructions there.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Linux Ubuntu
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ensure that both 
\family typewriter
make
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
g++
\family default
 are installed by entering the following command in the terminal:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings

\begin_layout Subsection
Mac OS X
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Before Beginning
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Before beginning to install the development tools, it is crucial that you
 complete any OS updates.
 If you don't, the installation of Xcode may fail with an ``unknown error''.
 (This is a known issue with OS X 10.6.x Snow Leopard and Xcode 3.2.6.) Do system
 updates by clicking the Apple symbol in the upper-left corner of the screen
 and then selecting ``App Store...'' or ``Software Update...''.
 Let the updater finish its course which may require restarting.
 Repeat this update process until there are no more updates.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Install Development Tools
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Open the App Store application and search for ``xcode''.
 On the result screen, select and install the Xcode application:

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After Xcode installation completes, run Xcode (agreeing to the Xcode license
 agreement).
 The last step is to install the command-line tools.
 If you have OSX 10.9 or above, open the Terminal application, and execute
 the command
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

xcode-select --install
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you have OSX 10.8 or below, you must install the command-line tools from
 inside of Xcode.
 This is accessible from the menu item Xcode -> Preferences...
 -> Downloads.

 Command Line Tools that work for your version of OS X.
 (Note that with older versions of Xcode the command line tools are included
 with Xcode.) Unfortunately, every major version of OS X seems to have a
 new and backwards-incompatible version of Xcode.

Install Code Editor
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You will need to install an editor that recognizes and syntax colorizes

 Be careful not to install MinGW in a path containing spaces, such as 
\family typewriter
C:
\backslash
Program Files (x86)
\backslash
MinGW
\family default
, as this will cause a lot of problems later on.
 The rest of the tutorial assumes

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Next, bring up a DOS prompt by clicking the Windows button in the lower-left
 corner, typing 
\family typewriter
cmd.exe
\family default
 into the search bar, and pressing enter.
 At the DOS prompt, execute the following commands:

mingw-get install msys-wget msys-unzip msys-man
\end_layout

\end_inset

This will install additional programs for MSYS that we will need later to
 install dependencies.
 When the install command is finished, close the DOS prompt window and move
 on to the next step.
\end_layout

 (or wherever you installed MinGW to) to the PATH environment variable.
 On your desktop, right click ``My Computer'' and select ``Properties''.
 In the ``System Properties'' window that pops up, click the ``Advanced''
 tab and then the button labeled ``Environment Variables''.
 On the new window that pops up, scroll down the list in the ``System variables'
' panel until you see the PATH variable.
 Click on PATH and then click the ``Edit...'' button.
 Add a 
\family typewriter
;
\family default
 between the last path in the variable and the path you are adding, 
\family typewriter
C:
\backslash
MinGW
\backslash
bin
\family default
.
 Be very careful when editing the PATH environment variable, removing anything
 from it might cause havoc to your system.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Next, you need to bring up a DOS prompt.
 Do this by clicking the Windows button in the lower-left corner, typing
 
\family typewriter
cmd.exe
\family default
 into the search bar, and pressing enter.
 At the DOS prompt execute the following commands:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

mingw-get update
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

mingw-get install msys-wget msys-unzip
\end_layout

\end_inset

(
\family typewriter
wget
\family default
 is a standard Unix program for retrieving files from the internet.) If the
 commands don't execute, then check that the PATH environment variable was
 set correctly and reboot the computer and try again.
 At this point, MinGW and MSYS are configured properly.
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Start MSYS
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Open a new MSYS shell (not to be confused with a DOS shell!) by launching
 MSYS from the Start menu or desktop or by running 
\family typewriter
C:
\backslash
MinGW
\backslash
msys
\backslash

\end_inset

Answer 'y' to continue the post install and then 'y' again that you have
 MinGW installed.
 Next, enter the path where you installed MinGW as you are instructed; this
 will likely be 
\family typewriter
C:/MinGW
\family default
 (note the direction of the slash!).
 When done, restart MSYS.
 At this point, installation of MinGW/MSYS is complete.

\begin_layout Standard
By default, the MSYS directory 
\family typewriter
C:

\family default
 will be mounted as both the root directory 
\family typewriter

 The first time you run MSYS it will create a 
\family typewriter
home
\family default
 directory in 
\family typewriter
C:
\backslash
MinGW
\backslash
msys
\backslash
1.0
\family default
.
 The

\begin_layout Section
Build-and-Run Applications
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While AlloSystem is intended to be used mainly as a library, it does provide
 a simple means of building and running custom applications that link to
 AlloSystem.
 It is flexible enough to be used all the way from building simple prototypes
 to creating complex applications.
 This section describes how to setup and use AlloSystem's ``build-and-run''
 capability.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By default, there are two directories recognized by the AlloSystem build-and-run
 facility: 
\family typewriter
examples/
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
work/
\family default
.
 The directory 
\family typewriter
examples/
\family default
 contains example source code for libraries.
 The directory 
\family typewriter
work/
\family default
 is for user application source files and thus will be of primary concern
 here.
 You can place any source (
\family typewriter
.cpp
\family default
) files having a 
\family typewriter
main()
\family default
 function in the 
\family typewriter
work/
\family default
 directory (or any subdirectories thereof) and compile and run the source
 with the command
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

$ make work/myfile.cpp
\end_layout

\end_inset

Remember, you must be in 
\family typewriter
~/code/allosystem/
\family default
 when running the 
\family typewriter
make
\family default
 command.
 The executable binary is placed in 
\family typewriter
build/bin/
\family default
 and has the same name as the source file.
 If you would only like to build the application, without also running it,
 then you can append 
\family typewriter
AUTORUN=0
\family default
 to the line above, i.e.,
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\begin_layout Section
GUI and Sound
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The following instructions are only required if you would like to use graphical
 user interface (GUI) or sound synthesis components in conjunction with
 AlloSystem.
 We use GLV as the GUI toolkit and Gamma as the sound synthesis library.

 Unzip them within the directory 
\family typewriter
~/code
\family default
 (alongside where you installed AlloSystem).
 Rename the GLV and Gamma directories to 
\family typewriter
GLV
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter

.
 From the shell, this will look like
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

Custom Project Directories
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "sub:Custom-Project-Directories"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is possible to configure AlloSystem to use your own custom project directory
 for its build-and-run facility.
 We will call this your 
\emph on
user directory
\emph default
 and refer to it in this document generically as 
\family typewriter
<userdir>
\family default
 from this point onward.
 The actual name of the user directory can be anything you choose as long
 as it is a valid path, e.g., 
\family typewriter
myprojects
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
mycode
\family default
 or your initials, such as 
\family typewriter
ljp
\family default
.
 Start by creating the directory 
\family typewriter
~/code/allosystem/<userdir>
\family default
/.
 Next, make a copy of the file 
\family typewriter
Makefile.usertemplate
\family default
 and name it 
\family typewriter
Makefile.user.
 Makefile.user
\family default
 must be in the folder
\family typewriter
 ~/code/allosystem/
\family default
 along with 
\family typewriter
Makefile.usertemplate.

\family default
 You can do this from the terminal with the commands
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

$ cd ~/code/allosystem/
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

$ cp Makefile.usertemplate Makefile.user
\end_layout

\end_inset

Now, open 
\family typewriter
Makefile.user
\family default
 in an editor and change the line reading
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

#RUN_DIRS += foo/
\end_layout

\end_inset

to
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

RUN_DIRS += <userdir>/
\end_layout

\end_inset

using the same directory name you created in the previous step.
 Notice the 
\family typewriter
#
\family default
 (comment symbol) is removed.
 Also, do not forget the trailing slash after 
\family typewriter
<userdir>
\family default
.
 Relative paths in 
\family typewriter
RUN_DIRS
\family default
 are relative to the the 
\family typewriter
allosystem/
\family default
 directory.
 At this point, AlloSystem will recognize your user directory as a valid
 build-and-run directory.
 You can add as many user directories as you like to 
\family typewriter
RUN_DIRS
\family default
 remembering to separate them with spaces.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While it is possible to have as many user build-and-run directories, sometimes
 it is convenient to be able to build and run sources from other directories
 without always having to add them to the 
\family typewriter
RUN_DIRS
\family default
 variable.
 This can be accomplished by creating a symbolic link in one of your valid
 build-and-run directories:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

$ cd ~/code/allosystem/
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

$ ln -s sourcedir/ <userdir>/targetdir
\end_layout

\end_inset

This creates a symbolic link to 
\family typewriter
sourcedir/
\family default
 that is treated like the directory 
\family typewriter
<userdir>/targetdir/
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Linking to Other Libraries
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If your projects need to link to libraries that are not already used by
 AlloSystem, then there is some additional configuration required.
 You can configure this in one of two ways—globally, where all projects
 link to specified libraries, or locally, where only a specific project
 links to specified libraries.
 To set up global linking, simply add the linker flags to your existing
 
\family typewriter
Makefile.user
\family default
 file.
 For example, to link to the FFTW and Magick++ libraries that were installed
 into 
\family typewriter
/usr/local/
\family default
, we would set up 
\family typewriter
Makefile.user
\family default
 as follows:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

# Somewhere in Makefile.user ...
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

# Append directories to be searched for library include files
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

CPPFLAGS += -I/usr/local/include/
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

# Append directories to be searched for library object files
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

LDFLAGS += -L/usr/local/lib/
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

# Append libraries to be linked to
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

LDFLAGS += -lfftw3f -lMagick++
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here, 
\family typewriter
CPPFLAGS
\family default
 is a string of C/C++ preprocessor flags and 
\family typewriter
LDFLAGS
\family default
 is a string of linker flags.
 The flag 
\family typewriter
-I
\family default
 adds a search path for the 
\family typewriter
#include
\family default
 preprocessor directive used when compiling code.
 The flag 
\family typewriter
-L
\family default
 adds a library search path for the linker, and 
\family typewriter
-l
\family default
 (lowercase letter l) tells the linker which libraries to link to (omitting
 the starting 
\family typewriter
lib
\family default
 and ending extension from the library object file name).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you would only like local linking, that is, linking to libraries for
 only one project, then place all the project's source files along with
 a file 
\family typewriter
flags.txt
\family default
 in a subdirectory of one of your user directories.
 Then, in 
\family typewriter
flags.txt
\family default
, add all the necessary linker flags in the same way as done above with
 
\family typewriter
Makefile.user
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Compiling Your Own Object Code
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There comes a time when you would like many separate projects to reuse your
 own custom code, akin to using a library.
 For example, you may have several utility functions or classes that you
 would like all projects to have access to.
 Let's say you have the two files 
\family typewriter
myutils.h
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
myutils.cpp
\family default
 that contain your custom functions and classes.
 At this point, all that is necessary is to place these files in some directory,
 say 
\family typewriter
~/code/allosystem/myutils/
\family default
, and add the following line to your existing Makefile.user file:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
inline false

\begin_layout Plain Layout

RUN_SRC_DIRS += myutils/
