##1. About

AlloSystem is a cross-platform suite of C++ components for building interactive multimedia tools and applications. It is organized into separate "allo" modules that can be compiled and linked to on a per need basis. The most important module, AlloCore, comprises core components that most other modules depend on, such as math utilities, system information, audio IO, and OpenGL-based windowing.


###1.1 Directory Structure

AlloSystem modules are located in subdirectories beginning with "allo". Each module has the general directory layout:

	MODULE_NAME/	- Header files (.h, .hpp)
	src/			- Source files (.c, .cpp)
	examples/		- Example code pertaining to this module
	share/			- Resource files for testing and demonstration purposes
	unitTests/		- Unit tests

The build folder (typically `./build/`) is organized using a Unix-style hierarchy as follows:

	bin/			- Binary executables
	include/		- Library header files
	lib/			- Libraries


##2. Installing Dependencies

The only mandatory dependency for AlloSystem is CMake, which is the build system used.

Other optional dependencies are:
 * APR
 * Assimp (v.2 or v.3 supported)
 * Freeimage
 * Freetype
 * GLEW
 * GLUT
 * Libsndfile
 * luajit (for alloutil)
 * GLV (for alloGLV)

You may not need all these dependencies if you plan to build only part of AlloSystem. The build system will try to find the dependencies available and build as much functionality as possible. However, if some dependencies are not available in your system, you won't have all functionality available and building some examples or existing code that uses it will fail.

AlloSystem provides cross-platform scripts to simplify downloading dependencies. From the `AlloSystem/` root directory, `cd` into a module directory and run the script `install_dependencies.sh`. For example, to install AlloCore dependencies, you would run these commands from `AlloSystem/`:

	$ cd allocore
	$ ./install_dependencies.sh
	$ cd ..

This will download and install all of the AlloCore dependencies using APT, MacPorts, Homebrew, or building from source.

##3. Running examples and projects

AlloSystem offers an easy way to try out examples and build simple projects without having to write makefiles or configure IDE projects. Any .cpp file placed within the AlloSystem sources can be built into an application with a line like:

	./run.sh allocore/examples/graphics/shaderSprites.cpp

This will also build any required dependencies and run CMake if needed.

You can also pass a directory instead of a filename, and all the source files in that directory will be built into a single application (you must ensure that one and only one of those files has a *main()* function).

You can make a debug build of the libraries and the application by running:

	./run.sh -d allocore/examples/graphics/shaderSprites.cpp

This will run the file in the debugger, so if the application crashes, it will drop you to the debugger shell. If you need to specify a particular debugger instead of the default `gdb`, adjust the *run.sh* script.

To build all files in a directory into a single application, just provide the directory to the run script:

	./run.sh -d project/many_files_in_this_folder

If you just want to build an executable without running it, then include the -n flag:

	./run.sh -n allocore/examples/graphics/shaderSprites.cpp

###3.1 Application dependencies and build flags

If a file called *flags.cmake* is found in the source directory for the run script, the CMake commands found in it will be passed to the CMake build system. This enables writing any kind of build instructions and commands that are specific to the files on that folder, and can be used to specify the required information for additional dependencies like library paths and names, include directories. A *flags.txt* file that adds support for an additional library will look like: 

	include_directories(/path/to/headers)
	target_link_libraries("${APP_NAME}" libname)

It can also be used to do platform specific actions, for example for setting compiler flags:

	if(${CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME} STREQUAL "Linux")
	  set(CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS "${CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS} -std=c++11 -Wno-deprecated-declarations")
	else()
	  set(CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS "${CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS} -std=c++11 -stdlib=libc++ -Wno-deprecated-declarations")
	endif()


###3.2 Additional tips
Note: If you are having trouble using tab autocompletion after the 'make' command, then it is likely that a completion rule has been defined elsewhere for make. You can disable this by adding to the bottom of your ~/.bashrc file

	complete -r make

which will restore the default autocompletion using the file system. If that still doesn't work, then you can try the command

	sudo mv /usr/share/bash-completion/completions/make /usr/share/bash-completion/completions/make_disabled

##4. Compilation Instructions

Compilation is done automatically when using the run script, but if you need AlloSystem as a library you can use these methods.


###4.1 Building AlloSystem libraries (Using Make on Linux and OS X, and MSYS on Windows)

You need to use CMake to configure the build for your system. You can build AlloCore like this:

An alternative to building the AlloSystem libraries is using the application building and running facilities provided by the *run.sh* script, see below.

To build the AlloSystem libraries, you need to use CMake to configure the build for your system:

	./distclean
	cmake .
	make

This will build all AlloSystem libraries in the `./build/lib` folder and the examples in the `./build/bin` folder.


###4.2 Building AlloSystem (XCode project)

Do:

	./distclean
	cmake . -GXcode
	open AlloSystem.xcodeprj

You will be able to run examples and debug from Xcode

###4.3 Building Allosystem (Visual Studio project)

Coming soon...


###4.4 Various CMake Options

If you want to build without examples:

	./distclean
	cmake . -DBUILD_EXAMPLES=0
	make

To produce a debug build:

	./distclean
	cmake . -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
	make

The CMake build system for AlloSystem is setup to build everything it finds y default. When hard dependencies for a particular module are not met, the module will not be built. When optional dependencies are not found, the module will be built without support for that particular functionality. This will be reported in the console text, and if the functionality is used, this might result in a "header not found" error or a linker error.

You can also optionally force or disable building of external modules setting the following variables:

* BUILD_GAMMA
* BUILD_GLV

like:

	cmake . -DBUILD_GAMMA=0

##5. Installing Allosystem

You can install the AlloSystem libraries and headers, which will allow CMake AlloSystem projects to use it instead of having to include all the AlloSystem sources in your project.

Using CMake configured for Makefiles, you will be able to install all of AlloSystem with headers by doing:

	sudo make install

You can specify a different install path by doing (e.g. to install in /opt/local):

	./distclean
	cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=/opt/local .
	sudo make install

You can uninstall with:

	xargs rm < install_manifest.txt
