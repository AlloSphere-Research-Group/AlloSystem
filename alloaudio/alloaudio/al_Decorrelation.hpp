	 * @brief Calculates deterministic phase decorrelation IRs
	 *
	 * The IRs are generated using the Zotter method (DAFX 2011). This method
	 * constructs an all-pass filter whose phase traces a sinusoid. The number
	 * of oscillations of the phase within the Nyquist band is called here
	 * deltaFreq and the amplitude -i.e. the maximum variation of phase that
	 * the filter creates- is called maxTau. The original paper for the technique
	 * does not provide ideas on how to apply it for multichannel decorrelation
	 * so what is done here is to add two ways of generating varying (but
	 * related) impulse responses. The maxFreqDev parameter determines the
	 * maximum deviation that each IR will have with respect to deltaFreq. The
	 * higher this value, the more decorrelated the IRs will be. The second
	 * method is to have a phaseDev parameter that randomizes the starting
	 * phase of the sinuoisoidal phase response.
	 *
	 * @param io The AudioIO object
	 * @param seed The random seed for the creation of decorrelated IRs. seed < 0 means seed from current time.
	 * @param deltaFreq The number of cycles in the sinusoidal phase response
	 * @param maxFreqDev The maximum random deviation around deltaFreq for each IR.
	 * @param maxTau The amplitude of the sinusoidal phase response. A value of 1.0 means maximum deviation before wrapping the phase around pi.
	 * @param startPhase The phase for the sine function that determines the phase at bin 0.
	 * @param phaseDev The maximum random deviation around startPhase.
