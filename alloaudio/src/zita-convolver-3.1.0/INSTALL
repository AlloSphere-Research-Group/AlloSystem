Dependencies
------------

Zita-convolver depends on libfftw3f and the corresponding
header files. For best performance you may consider to
compile fftw3 locally, with the best optimisation flags
for your platform.


Installing the library
----------------------

To make and install the library, cd to the libs directory,
su root, and 'make install'. This will install the lib and
header file in /usr/lib and /usr/include. To install to
other directories, see the Makefile. After the install
you can do a 'make clean' to return the libs directory
to its original state.
