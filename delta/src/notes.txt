Opportunity to run audio thread priority queue based on samplestamp times rather than seconds/nsecs. There would be no need for a separate process list.

Example 1:
	FFT inputs could trigger at arbitrary control rates, but still sample-locked. Of course, the FFT	itself needs to sample at block-rate, but accumulate internally.
	HOWEVER, we may need objects whose inputs run at different rates. Starting to think that it is the	inputs themselves which need to be block-rate triggered; one of which is 'hot'?

Example 2:
	Granular events could trigger at the exact onset and retrigger until done.
	HMMM, only the onset (and close) need to be accurate; in between it runs at normal block rate.

Next step is definitely dealing with packet management.
