For this demo to work, the DeviceServer (DS) needs to be able to find a folder of scripts for the application
"AllocoreTest". This folder is included in the same directory as this file. Move the folder to the
current location for default DS scripts (as specified in the DS preferences).

For more information about the DeviceServer, please see: http://www.allosphere.ucsb.edu/DeviceServer/
