This directory contains some data to test with IMOD.

golgi.mrc
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The data are a subset of a tomographic reconstruction taken from a tilt series 
in the High Voltage Electron Microscope at Boulder.

The specimen is a normal rat kidney (NRK) cell and the region shown is the 
trans-Golgi network (TGN).  For more information read

	Ladinsky, M.S., J.R. Kremer, P.S. Furcinitti, J.R. McIntosh, and
        K.E. Howell (1994) HVEM tomography of the trans-Golgi network:
        Structural insights and identification of a lace-like vesicle coat.
        J. Cell Biol. 127: 29-38.  

To view this data set in 3-d use the command,
% 3dmod golgi.mrc

golgi.imod
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
A model in imod format showing a vesicle and a microtubule.

To view the model on a full screen use the command,
   3dmodv -f golgi.imod

To view both the graphic and model data use the command,
   3dmod golgi.mrc golgi.imod

To edit and view the graphic data and model use the command
   3dmod golgi.mrc golgi.imod

See the 3dmod man page for more help in using 3dmod, and the Users Guide at
http://bio3d.colorado.edu/imod

To recreate the skin that is capped use the command
   imodmesh -C golgi.imod

yeastpore.mod
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is a model showing the nuclear envelope and the nuclear pores in a
dividing yeast cell, reconstructed from electron micrographs of serial
sections.  For more information on the data, see

	Winey, M., D. Yarar, T.H. Giddings, Jr., and D.N. Mastronarde
	(1997) Nuclear pore complex number and distribution throughout
	the Saccharomyces cerevisiae cell cycle by three-dimensional 
	reconstruction from electron micrographs of nuclear envelopes.  
	Mol. Biol. Cell 8: 2119-2132.


To view the model use the command
   3dmodv yeastpore.mod

The model demonstrates pseudo-transparency of a meshed surface and scattered
point displays.  Select the Edit-Objects menu item to adjust colors and
transparency.  The quality of the scattered points can be increased or
decreased with the g or G keys.  This model also contains a low-resolution
mesh that will display more quickly; use the r key to toggle between 
low-resolution and regular meshes.

The low-resolution mesh was created with 
   imodmesh -C -l -i 2 yeastpore.mod

You can replace the regular mesh with a more efficient one that will display 
somewhat faster using the command
   imodmesh -C -R .25 yeastpore.mod

dual.rec and example.mod
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
These are the files used to create the images for the Introduction to 3dmod.
You can open various dialogs to see the model properties that have been set.
The image file is a tomographic reconstruction of the kinetochore region of
a dividing PtK cell.

To view them, use the command
   3dmod dual.rec example.mod
