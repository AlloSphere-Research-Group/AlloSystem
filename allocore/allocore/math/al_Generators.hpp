	File description:
	Generator function objects

	A generator is a lightweight object that generates a sequence of elements.
	Generators have a standard interface specified by the Val class. 
	A const qualified generator only means that its generating function 
	parameters are held constant; its current value can change.
	
	When a generator is iterated (through its nullary function operator) it
	will compute its next value, store the result in its value member variable,
	and return its previously stored value. The reason the previous value is 
	returned is so that its value can be set directly and on its next iteration
	it will return that value.
