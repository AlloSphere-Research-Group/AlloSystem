/*!
	Asset manages the loading and parsing of 3D asset files
	Asset wraps the AssImp library.

	A scene contains
		- array of meshes
		- array of materials
		- array of textures
		- also: array of animations, array of lights, array of cameras
		- tree of nodes, starting from a root node

	A mesh contains
		- name
		- material (index into scene)
		- array of vertices
		- array of normals
		- array of colors
		- array of texcoords
		- arrays of tangents, bitangents
		- bones

	A material contains
		- array of properties
		- helper methods for retrieving textures

	A node contains
		- name
		- a 4x4 matrix transform relative to its parent
		- a list of children
		- a number of meshes (indexing scene arrays)
