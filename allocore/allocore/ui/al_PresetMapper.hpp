/**
 * @brief The PresetMapper class allows archiving and recalling preset maps
 *
 * Preset maps are saved as a directory containing the presets as well as a
 * preset map file that lists the presets in the map as well as assigning
 * an index to each.
 *
 * The preset map file is a text file, where each line looks like:
 *
 * @code
 * 0:preset_name
 * @endcode
 *
 * The index of the preset is separated by the preset name by a semi-colon. The
 * preset name should correspond to a file on disk called "preset_name.preset".
 * These files are located either within a preset map archive or a PresetHandler's
 * root directory.
 *
 * To archive a preset map, it's necessary to first register a PresetHandler
 * with registerPresetHandler() and then call archive().
