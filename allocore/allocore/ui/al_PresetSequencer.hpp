/**
 * @brief The PresetSequencer class allows triggering presets from a PresetHandler over time.
 *
 * In order to use a preset sequencer you must register a preset handler with
 * the sequencer:
 *
 * @code
 * PresetHandler presetHandler;
 * PresetSequencer sequencer;
 *
 * sequencer << presetHandler;
 * @endcode
 *
 * Sequences that trigger presets are stored in text files with the format:
 *
 * @code
 * preset1:0.0:3.0
 * preset2:4.0:2.0
 * preset3:1.0:1.0
 * ::
 * @endcode
 *
 * The first element in each line specifies the preset name that the PresetHandler
 * should load (i.e. a file called "preset1.preset" in the current directory).
 * The second element determines the time to get to the preset from the current state,
 * i.e. the morph time to reach the preset. The third element determines the time
 * the preset should be held after reaching it.
 *
 * The file should end with two colons (::).
 *
 * The directory where sequences are loaded is taken from the PresetHandler
 * object registered with the sequencer.
 *
