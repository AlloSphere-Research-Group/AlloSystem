/*
Allocore Example: Audio To Graphics

Description:
This example demonstrates how to visualize real-time audio. It uses a single 
ring buffer to buffer audio samples between the audio and graphics threads. Two 
sine waves are generated in the audio thread and drawn as a Lissajous curve in 
the graphics thread.
